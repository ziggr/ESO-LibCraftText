ZIG YOU LEFT OFF HERE

Goal is a table of regexes that can parse daily and master writ quest condition text.
Goal is NOT a translation table of set/trait/whatever strings.

Need REGEXes:
    Given a sealed master writ condition text:
    -- get requested crafting item, AS A STRING
    -- get requested crafting material AS A STRING
    -- get requested quality AS A STRING
    -- get requested set bonus AS A STRING
    -- get requested motif AS A STRING
    -- get requested trait AS A STRING
    -- get alchemy potion/poison name AS A STRING
    -- get alchemy potion/poison level AS A STRING
    -- get alchemy effect list, AS A STRING list
    -- get enchant level AS A STRING
    -- get enchant name AS A STRING
    -- get food/drink name AS A STRING
    Given a DAILY writ condition, same as above but likely DIFFERENT regexes:

Now, from those strings, get some sort of integer/constant.
THAT is where having tables of gear names, sets, materials, styles, all come in
handy. Which of those can be generated at runtime?



The only reason I'm playing with SEALED MASTER WRIT item_links is that it's easy
to write code to fabricate and iterate through them to see different values.
These values are likely to appear in QUEST CONDITION text later, so having tables
of them around in translation database can accelerate hand-work when calculating
regex strings. Especially for languages I cannot easily read (RU I'm looking at you).

Questions:
    -- do I really need lists of materials?


NEED SEALED MASTER WRITE ITEM LINKS FOR
-- HVY "rubedite Cuirass"
-- LGT "ancestor silk Arm Cops"
-- WW  "ruby ash Inferno Staff"
-- JW  "platinum Necklace"

Make sure that new .ToItemName() function works for all items, all languages

Use above output to figure out internal regex that will remove material name from item name.

-- continue on to other gear writ fields
    -- trait
    -- quality (get all 5 even though master writs only need last two)
    -- style/motif
    -- materials (bs, lgt, med, ww, jw)

Use the above to generate tables
Do NOT generate tables for set, style
Might have better way to get trait, I think there's an API for that


The

trying to extract "Cuirass" from "platinum Cuirass"

which implies some modified scan of items from sealed master write itemlinks
-- get proper BS/CL/WW/JW writ links?
-- use known material that you can scan for
-- probably burn the RE strings into a table within _Discover.lua's Discover() code rather than adding to lang_db because these are NOT the same RE strings that you use to scan quest conditions.

Will eventually get a list of craftable gear items

-- sets (already got that!)
-- quality (got that, could roll qualities 1-5 for grins)
-- traits
-- motif

-- probably should NOT add these to generated lang files: they are all
-- available from the ESO client at runtime. Could supply a function
-- to return them, given a writN number

-- ItemName(number) -> "Cuirass"
-- MaterialName(qual, crafting_type) -> "Ruby Ash"
-- Quality(level) -> "Epic"
-- Set(num) -> "Armor Master"
-- Motif(num) -> "Worm Cult"

-- Glyph
-- Alchemy item
-- Alchemy effect
-- Provisioning Item

Use these very same functions to power Discover()
But again, this is num->text generation which is the opposite of parse.
There's no reason to include these in lang files
And including them in public API is Feature Creep don't do it.

But including them in Discovery() might be helpful as we figure out parse
REs for quest text? Barely. But I _am_ curious. So I'm doing it.
