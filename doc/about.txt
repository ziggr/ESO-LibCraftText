Are you an add-on developer who compares quest names against a list of strings to figure out which quest is a daily crafting writ? Master writ?

This is a tiny library of localized strings for crafting quest recognition.

LibCraftText.DAILY_QUEST_TITLES = {
    [bs] = "Blacksmith Writ"
,   [cl] = "Clothier Writ"
,   [en] = "Enchanter Writ"
,   [al] = "Alchemist Writ"
,   [pr] = "Provisioner Writ"
,   [ww] = "Woodworker Writ"
,   [jw] = "Jewelry Crafting Writ"
}
...
LibCraftText.ROLIS_QUEST_TURN_IN = {

    ["accept"]         = "<Accept the contract."
,   ["finish"]         = "<Finish the job.>"
,   ["deliver_substr"] = "Deliver"

,   [bs] = "I've finished the Blacksmithing job."
,   [cl] = "I've finished the Clothier job."
